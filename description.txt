Project Overview: Fundus Image Super-Resolution with EDSR

This project implements a Super-Resolution pipeline for retinal fundus images, aiming to enhance image quality and preserve fine structural details crucial for medical analysis.

We experimented with Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution (EDSR)–style networks, including a lightweight variant (EDSR-Lite / EDSR-Bilinear) that balances performance and efficiency.

Dataset

High-Resolution (HR) Images: Retinal fundus scans used as ground truth.

Masks (Ground Truth Masks): Binary masks corresponding to the HR images, ensuring that training emphasizes medically relevant regions.

Model Architecture

Base Network: EDSR-Lite with residual blocks (skip connections for stable training).

Up sampling Layer: Pixel Shuffle for efficient resolution scaling.

Loss Functions (multi-component to balance sharpness, structure, and perceptual quality):

L1 Loss (masked) → pixel-wise reconstruction.

Perceptual Loss (VGG19) → ensures realistic textures.

SSIM Loss → preserves structural similarity and avoids artifacts.

Total Variation (TV) Loss → reduces checkerboard artifacts and enforces smoothness.

Training

Optimizer: AdamW with learning rate scheduling (Cosine Annealing).

Mixed precision training (AMP) for faster computation.

Early stopping to prevent overfitting.

Results

The network successfully improves resolution and clarity while minimizing artifacts such as checkerboard patterns.

Evaluation metrics include PSNR and SSIM, both improving steadily during training.

Inference outputs show sharper vessel structures and enhanced color representation compared to bicubic upscaling.

Inference

The trained model can be applied to new fundus images. The pipeline:

Load the low-resolution (LR) input image.

Perform super-resolution with the trained EDSR-based model.

Compare outputs against bicubic upscaling.

Display/save both the input and the super-resolved result with their respective dimensions.

Applications

Medical imaging (ophthalmology, retinal disease detection).

General image enhancement tasks where detail preservation is crucial.
